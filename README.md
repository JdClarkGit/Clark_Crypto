# Crypto App

Welcome to Crypto App, your definitive tool for seamlessly tracking and exploring a diverse array of cryptocurrencies. This platform provides a comprehensive and convenient solution for monitoring and viewing various crypto assets, all consolidated in a single, user-friendly interface.

## WHY

The impetus for developing Crypto App was to create an intuitive user interface that not only simplifies navigation but also delivers cryptocurrency data in a clear, accessible format. Drawing inspiration from my passion for tracking stock market trends, I set out to design a web application that aggregates all essential crypto information in one centralized location, enhancing both usability and efficiency.
